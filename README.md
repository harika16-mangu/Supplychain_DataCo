After conducting an extensive analysis of DataCo company's supply chain and logistics data from 2015 to 2018, it has been determined that a significant factor contributing to the decline in sales can be attributed to a specific underlying cause which is termed to be late delivery

## Supply Chain and Logistic Analysis for DataCo
This repository contains the project on supply chain and logistic analysis for DataCo, where i conducted an in-depth analysis on various parameters of the dataset. The analysis focused on factors such as shipping, sales, delivery status, late delivery risks, orders by customers, shipping mode, and more. The primary objective of the analysis was to identify whether late delivery was the main reason for the decline in sales of DataCo company from 2015 to 2018.Predicting the late delivery risks by using various other parameters

**Dataset Overview**
The dataset used for this analysis spans from 2015 to 2018 and includes comprehensive information on the supply chain and logistics operations of DataCo. It contains data on shipping details, sales figures, delivery statuses, late delivery risks, orders placed by customers, shipping modes, and other relevant metrics.

**Analysis Process**
The project involved several stages of analysis, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data exploration. The following steps were performed:

**Data Analysis**: We conducted a detailed analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics. This involved assessing the quality of the data, identifying missing values, and evaluating data integrity.

**Data Preprocessing**: To ensure accurate and reliable analysis, we performed preprocessing tasks such as data normalization, standardization, and handling missing values. This step aimed to prepare the dataset for further analysis.

**Data Cleaning**: We implemented various data cleaning techniques to address inconsistencies, outliers, and errors in the dataset. This process involved removing duplicates, correcting inaccuracies, and handling any discrepancies in the data.

**Data Exploration**: We explored the dataset using various statistical and visual techniques to gain insights into the supply chain and logistic operations of DataCo. We analyzed the relationships between different variables, identified trends, and detected patterns in the data.

**Analysis Focus: Late Delivery Risk and Sales Decline and predicting the late delivery risks of a product using various other parameters within dataset**
One of the main focal points of the analysis was to assess the impact of late delivery risk on the decline in sales for DataCo. By leveraging the available data, we specifically investigated the correlation between late deliveries and sales figures from 2015 to 2018.

**Key Insights**
Throughout the analysis, we extracted interesting insights regarding the supply chain and logistic operations of DataCo. These insights provided valuable information for understanding the dynamics of the company's performance. Some of the key findings include:

Identification of factors contributing to late delivery risks.
Assessment of the impact of late deliveries on sales decline.
Evaluation of customer order patterns and preferences.
Analysis of shipping modes and their influence on delivery performance.

This repository is organized as follows:

notebooks/: This directory contains Google Colab notebooks detailing the step-by-step analysis process.
results/: This directory holds the results of the analysis, including visualizations, reports, and insights.


Investigating other factors that might contribute to the decline in sales.
Implementing predictive modeling techniques to forecast sales based on supply chain and logistics data.
Assessing the effectiveness of different strategies for mitigating late delivery risks and improving overall performance.
We encourage researchers, analysts, and data enthusiasts to leverage this project as a foundation for further analysis and contribute to the understanding of supply chain and logistics dynamics in the context of DataCo.
